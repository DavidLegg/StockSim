# StockSim

A trimmed-down, high-efficiency backtesting engine implemented in pure C. This is a personal project for me to test some ideas for algorithmic trading, and to practice writing close-to-the-metal, parallel C code.

Note that this project is meant to run fast. It trades flexibility and sometimes stability for runtime efficiency.
**Do not use this for actual algorithmic trading.**
