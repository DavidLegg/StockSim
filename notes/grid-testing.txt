    Setup:
        Base Scenario:
            $100.00
            Historical pricing
            25 Base Point transaction fee
            MeanReversion
                emaDiscount = 0.01^(1/(24*60))
                initialSamples = 2880
            TimeHorizon
                1 Month
    Grid Parameters
        MeanReversion
            buyFactor  : 0.9 to 1.0
            sellFactor : 1.001 to 1.100
            stopFactor : 0.800 to 0.995
            5 values each
        100 shots on each combo, spread over 300 days in 2019

    Results: 
        buy, sell at min: uniformly bad, avg -0.2% profit
        increasing sell factor improves this to +%3 profit with 1.06-1.08
        increasing buy factor improves this +%3.3 profit with 0.98 & stop factor ~0.85

GT2:
    Setup:
        Base Scenario:
            $100.00
            Historical pricing
            25 Base Point transaction fee
            MeanReversion

                1 Month
    Grid Parameters
        MeanReversion
            buyFactor  : 0.96 to 1.0
            sellFactor : 1.05 to 1.09
            stopFactor : 0.83 to 0.87
            5 values each
        100 shots on each combo, spread over 300 days in 2019

    Results:
        Sell @ 1.050 is a clear optimum
        Buy  @ 0.968 maximizes within that, at ~59% success across a range of stop values
        Stop between 0.838 and 0.862 nearly identical, best at 0.846

    Temp - Raw Results:
        Grouping by highest % runs with profit
        60%
            buy 0.984, sell 1.050, stop 0.85

            KEEP buy 0.968, sell 1.050, stop 0.846, profit +7.9%
            KEEP buy 0.968, sell 1.050, stop 0.854, profit +7.6%

            KEEP buy 0.968, sell 1.050, stop 0.838, profit +7.7%

Next test to run: try long-period tests with near-optimal parameters to validate these results.
